# Singly Linked List
A linear data structure in which each node holds a value and a reference to the next node.

## Challenge
Write an implementation of singly linked lists with the following methods:
- `insert` - Takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- `includes` - Takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- `print` - Takes in no arguments and returns a collection all of the current Node values in the Linked List.

## Approach & Efficiency
LinkedList stores both a head and tail reference to allow for O(1) insertions at either head or tail.
- `insert()` efficiency: O(1) Time, O(1) Space at either head or tail.
- `includes()` efficiency: O(n) Time, O(1) Space
- `print()` efficiency: O(n) Time, O(n) Space

## API
- `LinkedListSingle` - Class which describes a singly-linked list.
  - `.insert([value])` - Value is optional. Will insert the specified value (or `null`) at the head of the list.
  - `.insert([value], 'tail')` - Will insert the specified value (or `null`) at the tail of the list.
  - `.includes(value)` - Searches for a specified value in the list. Returns `true` or `false`. Returns `null` if no value is specified.
  - `.print()` - Returns a collection (array) of the values in the list.
- `NodeSingle` - Class describing a singly-linked node.
